# Photo Roster Names

This question was designed for course staff to drill on memorizing student faces and names.
It takes a `roster.json` file supplied by the course, presumably downloaded from Canvas.

A helper script, `canvasRoster.py`, was created to assist downloading the roster from Canvas.
It needs a Canvas personal access token to download. See

for more instructions on generating a token.

See inside the question HTML for more documentation.
