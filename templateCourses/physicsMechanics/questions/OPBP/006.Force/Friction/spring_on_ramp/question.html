In the figure below m = {{ params.m }} kg, $\theta$ = {{ params.theta }}$^\circ$, and k = {{ params.k }} N/m.
In this problem assume that the ramp never moves and that there is friction between the block and the ramp.

By what length is the spring stretched?
Assume that the coefficient of kinetic friction is $\mu_k$ = {{ params.uk }}.
