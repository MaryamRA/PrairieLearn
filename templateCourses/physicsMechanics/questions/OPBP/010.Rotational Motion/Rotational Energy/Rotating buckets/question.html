A pair of buckets are connected by a *massless* rod.
As shown in the figure, the buckets rotate about an axis through the centre of mass of the two-bucket system.

	<markdown>If each bucket has a mass $m$ and the rod has length $l$, what is the rotational inertia of the system?
Give your answer in terms of $m$ and $l$.
Treat the buckets as point masses and recall that $I = \sum\limits_i m_ir_i^2$.

Note that it may not be necessary to use every variable. Use the following table as a reference for each variable:

| For  | Use   |
|----------|-------|
| $m$  | m  |
| $l$  | l  |
