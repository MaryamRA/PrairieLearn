  You need to model the temperature on the surface of a metal undergoing
  a complicated chemical reaction. You have two options for doing so:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Program A</strong> is an exact model that gives you the correct temperature with
  no error. It is expensive to run, however, taking ${{params.time}}$ minutes on your
  best available computer.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Program B</strong> is a numerical model that gets more accurate the longer you
  allow it to run. When run on your best available computer, the error vs
  time tradeoff is shown in the plot below. </p>

Which program will run faster, assuming that you need to approximate the
temperature with an error of at most $10^{-{{params.c}}}$ degree Celsius?
