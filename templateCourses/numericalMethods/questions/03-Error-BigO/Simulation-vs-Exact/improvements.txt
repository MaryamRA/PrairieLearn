Yuchen feedback in Spring 2019:

this randomization is good, BUT the problem with this question is
that the slope of the generated plot needs to be steeper.
In the current setup, the answer is "Problem A" with high probability.

IMPROVE: make both answers have more similar probabilities to appear.
Maybe also consider randomizing the curve as well .. to have different shapes , functions etc, would be more interesting

Fall 2018: Looking over the data, 112/419 students got answer B as the correct one. Could be better distribution, but actually not as bad as I thought based on the comment above.
