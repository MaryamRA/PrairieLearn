  Consider the matrix ${\bf A}$:
</p>
 $${\bf A}=<pl-matrix-latex params-name="A" digits='0'></pl-matrix-latex>$$
 <p>
   What is the minimal approximation error
    $\|{\bf A}-{\bf A}_1\|_2$ achievable by a rank-1 approximation ${\bf A}_1$ to ${\bf A}$?
 </p>

  Hint: Can you determine this without explicitly calculating the SVD?

  Make sure you are getting this question correctly without having to perform
  the SVD of the matrix A. Can you tell what is the rank of the matrix A?
  What do you know about the error of the best rank-k approximation?

Matrix A has rank equal to 1 (only one linearly independent column),
so the rank one approximation is exact.
