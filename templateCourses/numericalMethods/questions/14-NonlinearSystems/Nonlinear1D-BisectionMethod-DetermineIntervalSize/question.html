PL question asks for interval length. Relate questions ask for L and R bounds.
Still need to implement the same question as relate.

<pl-question-panel>
<p>
  You wish to find a root of the function $f(x) = (x-{{params.a}})^3$. You use the
  bisection method with an initial interval that has the left and right endpoints
  $L = {{params.L}}$ and $R = {{params.R}}$. What is the length of the interval
 after {{params.n}} iterations of bisection?
