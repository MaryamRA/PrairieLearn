    Suppose you're the owner of a smoothie shop and that you have three
    fruits available to make smoothies: bananas, blueberries, and
    strawberries.  You sell three types of smoothies, and each type requires a
    different amount of each fruit. See below the ingredient list for each smoothie:
  </p>

  <p>  Classic:  {{params.a}} bananas, {{params.b}} cups of blueberries, and {{params.c}} cup of
    strawberries </p>

  <p>   Blue:  {{params.d}} cups of blueberries and {{params.f}} cups of strawberries</p>

  <p>  Strawnana:  {{params.e}} bananas and {{params.g}} cups of strawberries </p>

  <p>
    At the end of the day you have used the following ingredients:  {{params.bananas}} bananas,
     {{params.blueberries}} cups of blueberries and {{params.strawberries}} cups of strawberries.
  </p>

  <p>
     To figure out how many smoothies of each type were sold during the day,
    you set up the linear system:
  </p>

  <p>
    $
    \begin{bmatrix}
  a_{11} & 0 & a_{13} \\
  a_{21}  & a_{22} &  0\\
    {{params.c}} & a_{32} & {{params.g}}\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix} {{params.bananas}} \\ {{params.blueberries}} \\ {{params.strawberries}} \end{bmatrix}.
    $
  </p>

  <p>
    What is the entry ${{params.outputlabel}}$ in the matrix?
  </p>

</pl-question-panel>

<p>
  <pl-integer-input answers-name="out" label="${{params.outputlabel}} = $"></pl-integer-input>
</p>


<pl-question-panel>

  <p>
  Using the system above, you determined that you sold {{params.Nclassic}} Classic smoothies. How many {{params.label2}} smoothies did you sell?
  </p>

</pl-question-panel>

<p>
  <pl-integer-input answers-name="out2" label="Number of {{params.label2}} smoothies = "></pl-integer-input>
</p>
