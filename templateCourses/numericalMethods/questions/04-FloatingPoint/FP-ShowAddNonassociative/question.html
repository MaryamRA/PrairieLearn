    As discussed in lecture, basic algebra operations actually break down in
    floating point arithmetic. Take for instance the associativity property of
    the real numbers under addition where the following would be true,

    <br><br>

    $$
    x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z \qquad x, y, z, \in \mathbb{R}
    $$

    <br><br>

    But in floating point arithmetic, the equality relation does not necessarily
    hold. 

    <br><br>

    Find an $x, y, z$ such that, $x + (y + z) \neq (x + y) + z$. Enter your
    numbers below.  
    
    <br><br>
    <i>Hint:</i> think about the concept of machine epsilon.

  <p> Due to roundoff error associativity property does not always hold. Try to think of $x,y,z$ values that result ion large roundoff error. Refer to slide 12-17 'Rounding errors' section for more hints.</p>
